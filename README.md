# Element Compare

[Element Compare](https://elementcompare.vercel.app/) is a single-page application showcasing the periodic table in its authentic structure and is developed with Next.js 14, React.js 18 and TypeScript.

Users can:

-   Highlight elements based on their types.
-   Select elements to compare their properties.
-   Inspect individual element properties.
-   Toggle between dark and light modes.

> [!NOTE]
> The app is not responsive below 1260px due to the shape of the periodic table, so it is not recommended to use it on devices with a screen size smaller than 1260px.
